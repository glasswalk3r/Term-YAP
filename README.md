# Term-YAP
Term-YAP means "Yet Another Pulse for Terminal"

Term::YAP is a Moo based class to implement a "pulse" bar in a terminal. A pulse bar doesn't actually keep track of progress from any task being executed but at least shows that the program is working instead of nothing for the end user.

This is the parent class and some methods were not implemented, you probably want to look for subclasses to get an implementation.

This module started as a shamelessly copy from Term::Pulse project, nowadays it keeps the same features but with a different implementation.
