Don't even bother trying to run this with prove... the output will not be the expected one.
Just use "perl -Ilib" to run this test and be able to see the ASCII animation.
Since you will be watching... you should see a "pulse bar" running for a while, stopping and starting again once more.
Something like this:

testing............................Done
testing...[  /             ] (0.400642 sec elapsed)

Now check it yourself:
BLOCK
