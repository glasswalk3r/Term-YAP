Term::YAP - show pulsed progress bar in terminal

=cut

use Types::Standard 1.000005 qw(Str Int Bool Num);

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Term::YAP;
    my $yap = Term::YAP->new( { name => 'Checking', rotate => 0, time => 1 } );
    $yap->start(); # start the pulse
    # do something between
    $yap->stop() # stop it

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Term::YAP is a L<Moo> based class to implement a "pulse" bar in a terminal. A pulse bar doesn't actually keep track of progress from any task being executed
but at least shows that the program is working instead of nothing for the end user.

This is the parent class and some methods were not implemented, you probably want to look for subclasses to get an implementation.

This module started as a shamelessly copy from L<Term::Pulse>, nowadays it keeps the same features but with a different implementation.

=head1 EXPORT

Nothing.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

All attributes are optional and have their respective default values.

=head2 name

A simple message displayed before the pulse. The default value is 'Working'.

=cut

has name =>
  ( is => 'ro', isa => Str, default => 'Working', reader => 'get_name' );

=head2 rotatable

Boolean. Rotates the pulse if set to true. It is false by default.

=cut

has rotatable =>
  ( is => 'ro', isa => Bool, default => 0, reader => 'is_rotatable' );

=head2 time

Boolean. Display the elapsed time if set to 1. Turn off by default.

=cut

has time => ( is => 'ro', isa => Bool, default => 0, reader => 'show_time' );

=head2 size

Set the pulse size. The default value is 16.

=cut

has size => ( is => 'ro', isa => Int, default => 16, reader => 'get_size' );

=head2 start_time

The time (Unix Epoch) that the pulse bar started in seconds.

This attribute is "private".

=cut

has start_time => (
    is     => 'rw',
    isa    => Num,
    reader => '_get_start',
    writer => '_set_start',
);

=head2 usleep

The microseconds elapsed that each pulse has between each other. The default value is 200000.

This attribute is "private".

=cut

has usleep =>
  ( is => 'ro', isa => Num, reader => '_get_usleep', default => 200000 );

=head2 running

Boolean. If true, the pulse was started, false otherwise.

=cut

has running => (
    is      => 'ro',
    isa     => Bool,
    reader  => 'is_running',
    writer  => '_set_running',
    default => 0
);

=head2 debug

Boolean. If true, additional messages (which you mangle output) will by printed.

Defaults to false.

=cut

has debug => (
    is      => 'rw',
    isa     => Bool,
    reader  => 'is_debug',
    writer  => 'set_debug',
    default => 0
);

=head1 METHODS

=head2 is_running

Getter for C<running> attribute.

=head2 BUILD

Install handlers for signals C<INT> and C<__DIE__>.

=cut

sub BUILD {

    my $self = shift;

    $SIG{INT}     = sub { $self->stop };
    $SIG{__DIE__} = sub { $self->stop };

}

=head2 get_name

Returns the value of the name attribute.

=head2 is_rotatable

Returns the value of rotatable attribute.

=head2 show_time

Returns the value of time attribute.

=head2 get_size

Returns the value of size attribute.

=head2 start

Starts the pulse. Returns the value of C<running> attribute.

=head2 is_debug

Returns the value set of C<debug> attribute.

=head2 set_debug

Setter for the C<debug> attribute.

        return 1;

        return 0;
    }
}
