=head1 NAME

Term::YAP::iThread - subclass of Term::YAP implemented with ithreads

=cut

=head1 SYNOPSIS

See parent class.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Subclass of L<Term::YAP> implemented with ithreads. The pun with it's name is intended.

Despite the limitation of L<http://perldoc.perl.org/threads.html#WARNING|'ithreads'> some platforms (like Microsoft Windows) does not work well
with process handling of Perl. If you in this case, this implementation of L<Term::YAP> might help you.

If you program code does not handle C<ithreads> correctly, consider initiation a Term::YAP::iThread object in a C<BEGIN> block to avoid loading
the code that does not support C<ithreads>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

Additionally to all attributes from superclass, this class also has the C<queue> attribute.

=head2 queue

Keeps a reference of a L<Thread::Queue> instance. This instance is created automatically during L<Term::YAP::iThread> creation.

=cut

has queue => (
    is      => 'rw',
    isa     => InstanceOf ['Thread::Queue'],
    reader  => 'get_queue',
    builder => sub { Thread::Queue->new() }
);

=head2 detach

A "private" attribute. Used to control when the created thread is expected to exists it's infinite loop after C<start_pulse> method invocation.

=cut

has detach => (
    is      => 'rw',
    isa     => Bool,
    reader  => '_no_detach',
    writer  => '_set_detach',
    default => 1
);

=head1 METHODS

The following methods are overriden from parent class:

=over

=item start

=item stop

=back

=head2 get_queue

Getter for the C<queue> attribute.

=head2 BUILD

Creates a thread right after object instantiation.

The thread will start only after C<start> method is called. 

=cut

sub BUILD {

    my $self = shift;
    my $thread = threads->create( sub { $self->_keep_pulsing() } );
    $thread->detach();

}

around start => sub {

    my ( $orig, $self ) = ( shift, shift );
    $self->get_queue()->enqueue('start');
    $self->_sleep();
    my $status = $self->get_queue()->pending();

    if ( $status == 0 ) {
        $self->_set_running(1);    #thread dequeued the start string
    }
    else {
        $self->_set_running(0);
    }
    $self->$orig;

};

around _keep_pulsing => sub {

    my ( $orig, $self ) = ( shift, shift );

    while ( $self->_no_detach() ) {

        my $task = $self->get_queue()->dequeue();

        if ( $task eq 'start' ) {

            $self->$orig(@_);

        }

    }

};

around _is_enough => sub {

    my ( $orig, $self ) = ( shift, shift );

    my $message = $self->get_queue()->dequeue_nb();

    if ( ( defined($message) ) and ( $message eq 'stop' ) ) {

        return 1;

    }
    else {

        return 0;

    }

};

around stop => sub {

    my ( $orig, $self ) = ( shift, shift );
    $self->get_queue()->enqueue('stop');
    $self->$orig;

};

=pod

=head2 DEMOLISH

This method will take care to "terminated" the L<Thread::Queue> object used to provide communication with the thread.

=cut

sub DEMOLISH {

    my $self = shift;
    $self->get_queue()->end();

}

=pod

=head1 CAVEATS

To enable usage of this module with code that does not supports L<threads>, this class will create a detached thread as soon as the object
was created. This thread will remain active until the end of the program, waiting to receive a command to start the pulse (or stop it).

That said, the class will not try to create new threads and will not check if the created thread exited successfully (but it does check if
the thread is retrieving items from the L<Thread::Queue> object created).
