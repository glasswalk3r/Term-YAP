=head1 NAME

Term::YAP::Process - process based subclass of Term::YAP

=cut

=head1 SYNOPSIS

See parent class.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a C<fork> base implementation of L<Term::YAP>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

All from parent class plus the described below.

=head2 child_pid

The PID from the child process created to start the pulse.

This is a read-only attribute and it's value is set after invoking the C<start> method.

=cut

has child_pid => (
    is      => 'ro',
    isa     => Int,
    reader  => 'get_child_pid',
    writer  => '_set_child_pid',
    clearer => 1
);

=head2 usr1

This class uses a USR1 signal to stop the child process of printing the pulse bar.

This read-only attribute holds the signal number (an integer) that is built during class instantiation depending
on the platform where is executed.

=cut

has usr1 => (
    is      => 'ro',
    isa     => Int,
    reader  => 'get_usr1',
    writer  => '_set_usr1',
    builder => \&_define_signal
);

=head2 enough

This read-only attribute is a boolean used by the child process to check if it should stop printing the pulse bar.

You probably won't need to use externally this attribute.

=cut

has enough => (
    is      => 'ro',
    isa     => Bool,
    default => 0,
    reader  => 'is_enough',
    writer  => '_set_enough'
);

has parent => (
    is      => 'ro',
    isa     => Int,
    default => 0,
    reader  => 'is_parent',
    writer  => '_set_parent'
);

=head1 METHODS

Some parent methods are overriden:

=over

=item * 

start

=item *

stop

=back

And some others are implemented by this class.

=head2 is_enough

Getter for C<enough> attribute.

=head2 get_usr1

Returns the value of C<usr1> attribute.

=head2 get_child_pid

Returns the value of the C<child_pid> attribute.

=head2 is_parent

Getter for C<parent> attribute.

=head2 start

Method overrided from parent class.

This method will use C<fork> to create a child process to create the pulse bar.

The child process will have a signal handler for the USR1 signal to stop the pulse bar.

=cut

around start => sub {

    my ( $orig, $self ) = ( shift, shift );

    if ( $self->is_parent() and $self->get_child_pid() ) {

        confess "no fork() before stopping " . $self->get_child_pid();

    }

    my $child_pid = fork();

    if ($child_pid) {

        #parent
        print "I'm a parent: $$\n" if ( $self->is_debug );
        $self->_set_child_pid($child_pid);
        $self->_set_running(1);
        $self->_set_parent(1);
        print "$$ forked ", $self->get_child_pid, "\n" if ( $self->is_debug );
        $self->$orig;

    }
    else {
        #child
        print "I'm a child: $$\n" if ( $self->is_debug );
        $SIG{USR1} = sub {
            $self->_set_enough(1);
        };
        $self->_keep_pulsing();
        exit 0;

    }

};

sub _define_signal {

    my %sig_num;
    unless ( $Config{sig_name} && $Config{sig_num} ) {
        confess "No sigs?";
    }
    else {
        my @names = split ' ', $Config{sig_name};
        @sig_num{@names} = split ' ', $Config{sig_num};

        confess("this platform does not include USR1 signal")
          unless ( exists( $sig_num{USR1} ) );

        return $sig_num{USR1};

    }

}

=head2 stop

Method overrided from parent class.

This method will send a USR1 signal with C<kill> to the child process executing the
pulse bar.

The child process termination will be handled with C<waitpid>.

=cut

around stop => sub {

    my ( $orig, $self ) = ( shift, shift );

    #if not the parent, get out
    if ( $self->is_parent() ) {

# :WORKAROUND:11/21/2015 07:33:13 PM:: don't know why, this is being called more than once, thus checking if child_pid is defined to avoid errors
        if ( $self->get_child_pid ) {

            print "$$ preparing to kill ", $self->get_child_pid, "\n"
              if ( $self->is_debug() );
            my $count = kill $self->get_usr1(), $self->get_child_pid();
            if ( $self->is_debug() ) {
                print "shit, child didn't receive the signal: $count\n"
                  unless ( $count == 1 );
            }
            $self->_sleep();
            my $pid = waitpid( $self->get_child_pid(), 0 );
            if ( $self->is_debug ) {
                if ( $pid == -1 ) {
                    print "we got a problem\n";
                }
                else {
                    print "child $pid is gone\n";
                }
            }
            $self->clear_child_pid();

        }

    }
    $self->$orig();

};

around _is_enough => sub {

    my ( $orig, $self ) = ( shift, shift );
    return $self->is_enough();

};
